## Project Overview

MongoBox is a lightweight in-memory MongoDB emulator with wire protocol support. It speaks real MongoDB wire protocol (OP_MSG) so any standard MongoDB driver can connect. Powered by Mingo query engine for MongoDB-compatible query matching and aggregation.

### Core Principle: MongoDB Behavioral Parity

**MongoBox must behave identically to real MongoDB for all supported operations.**

**Rules:**

- Every behavioral difference between MongoBox and the real MongoDB is a **bug**
- NEVER classify any behavioral divergence as acceptable or "good enough"
- When implementing a feature, the definition of "done" is: **behaves identically to real MongoDB**
- When in doubt about MongoDB behavior, research the real MongoDB behavior first — don't guess

**Verification standard:**

- Every implementation MUST be verified against real MongoDB behavior
- Error codes, error messages, return values, side effects — ALL must match
- If real MongoDB returns a specific error code, MongoBox returns that exact error code

### Architecture Decision Records

Location: `docs/adr/`

**Naming:** `##-topic-name.md` (e.g., `01-pure-js-engine.md`)

**Rules:**

- Before implementing architectural features, check if a relevant ADR exists
- Follow decisions documented in ADRs
- When making new architectural decisions, create an ADR

## Before Starting Any Task

**MANDATORY: Before writing any code, read the project documentation.**

This ensures consistency with existing patterns. Skipping this step leads to code that doesn't match project conventions.

## Voice Input Recognition

The user often uses voice recognition. Text may contain transcription errors.

- Auto-correct obvious errors from context
- If unclear or ambiguous - ask for clarification
- Try to fix independently when confident, but verify when uncertain

## When to Apply These Guidelines

**CRITICAL: File operation rules apply ONLY when working with repository files.**

✅ **Apply rules when:** Creating, editing, or deleting files; organizing directory structure; writing documentation to disk

❌ **DO NOT apply when:** Having regular conversation in chat; providing analysis or advice without creating files

**Default behavior:** If user asks for analysis/discussion without mentioning "create", "write", "document" - respond in chat only.

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

**Note:** These rules do NOT apply to AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md config files.

**Language:**

- All documentation files (\*.md) MUST be written in English, regardless of conversation language
- Translate content to English before writing to disk

**README consistency (docs/ and work/):**

- Every directory in `docs/` and `work/` MUST have a README.md with links to all files and subdirectories
- When adding/removing files, update the parent README.md
- Source code directories (`src/`) do NOT require README.md files

**README is navigation only:**

- Any README.md file is for **navigation only** — never put actual content in README files
- Actual content goes in separate named files (e.g., `summary.md`, `research.md`, `overview.md`)

**Linking rules:**

- ALL links to directories MUST point to README.md explicitly
  - ✅ Good: `[base/](base/README.md)`
  - ❌ Bad: `[base/](base/)`
- Link text should be readable, not technical filenames
  - ✅ Good: `[base environment](base/README.md)`
  - ❌ Bad: `[README.md](base/README.md)`

**No absolute or external local paths:**

- NEVER write absolute filesystem paths in documentation files (e.g., `/Users/...`, `/home/...`, `/tmp/...`)
- NEVER write local paths that point outside this repository (e.g., `~/other-project/...`, `../other-repo/...`)
- This includes paths from tool output — always convert them before writing to files
- For files within the repository, use repository-relative paths (e.g., `src/engine/parser.ts`, `docs/adr/01-wasm.md`)
- For external projects, use GitHub URLs instead
- **Verify all external URLs** before writing them to files — fetch the page to confirm it exists and contains expected content. LLM-generated URLs are frequently hallucinated

**Navigation:**

- Every .md file MUST have a back link to parent README
- Place navigation at the bottom after `---` separator
  - Example: `[← Back to Main](README.md)` or `[← Back](../README.md)`

### Work Structure

Location: `work/`

- **Research** (R01, R02...) — `R##-name/research.md`
- **Stories** (S01, S02...) — `S##-name/story.md`
- **Tasks** (T01, T02...) — nested under stories or research

### Board

Location: `work/board.md`

Workflow:

- Start task → add to "In Progress"
- Finish task → remove from board (no "Completed" section)

### Localized File Synchronization

Translations (`.<lang>.md`, e.g., `.de.md`, `.fr.md`) are optional and created only on explicit user request. When a localized version exists, it MUST be kept in sync with the primary English file.

Before completing ANY file edit task:

- Check if localized versions exist (e.g., `overview.md` → check for `overview.*.md`)
- If localized versions exist: Apply identical changes to ALL versions
- If only the primary version exists: Edit that version only

**Link consistency in localized files:** Internal links must point to the same locale:

- ✅ Correct: `[components](components/README.de.md)` (in a `.de.md` file)
- ❌ Wrong: `[components](components/README.md)` (mixing locales)

### File and Directory Reorganization

When moving or renaming files/folders:

1. Use `Grep` to search for all mentions of the file/folder path in `.md` files
2. Document all files that reference the path
3. Update all found references to point to the new location
4. Verify navigation links in moved files point to correct parent directories

### File Organization Principle

Code must be modular. File structure must reflect that modularity. The goal is grouping rules that naturally produce small, focused files — not size limits or reactive splitting.

A large file is not a problem in itself — it is a symptom of wrong grouping rules. The fix is never "split this file" — the fix is "find the right decomposition principle so this file wouldn't have existed in the first place." There is no line count threshold. A 300-line file with one cohesive responsibility is fine. A 150-line file with two unrelated responsibilities is not.

Code that evolves together should live close together (same module, same directory); code that evolves independently should be separated. This is an important grouping criterion.

### Test Placement

Tests must be co-located with the code they test (e.g., `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts` in the same directory). Do not separate tests into a dedicated test tree.
### File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., `canvas-renderer.ts`)

### Commit Message Format

First line: imperative mood, lowercase start, no trailing period:

- `add canvas rendering component`
- `fix websocket reconnection bug`
- `update content type system`

For larger commits, add brief description after a blank line (standard git convention):

```
add websocket reconnection logic

handle network interruptions with exponential backoff
```

Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" to commit messages

### Git Push Policy

- NEVER run `git push` without explicit user request
- Only push when user explicitly says "push" or "git push"
- After commit, wait for user instruction before pushing

### PR Merge Policy

- Use `--squash` by default when merging PRs (unless explicitly specified otherwise)
- Always write a custom commit message for the squash commit (summarizing PR changes)
- Delete the source branch after merge with `--delete-branch`

### Rolling Back Changes

When discarding or reverting local changes:

- **ALWAYS stash first** before any destructive git operations (`git checkout .`, `git restore .`, `git reset --hard`, etc.)
- Use `git stash -u` to include untracked files
- This ensures work is never permanently lost — it can always be recovered via `git stash pop`

### Pre-Commit Self-Analysis

Before each commit, briefly consider:

1. **Friction points** — Were there misunderstandings, repeated corrections, or user frustration?
2. **Pattern recognition** — Did the same issue occur multiple times in this session?
3. **Process gaps** — Is there a missing guideline that would have prevented the problem?

If improvements are identified:

- Suggest specific AGENTS.md changes to the user
- Keep suggestions actionable and concise
- Don't suggest changes for one-off issues — only recurring patterns

**Anti-loop safeguard:** Don't suggest meta-rules about suggesting rules. Focus on concrete workflow improvements.

### Branching Strategy

- Feature branches: `feature/<name>` (e.g., `feature/schema`)
- Small fixes and refactoring can go directly to main
- Large features and breaking changes go through feature branches

### After Switching Branches or Pulling

After `git checkout`, `git switch`, or `git pull` that includes changes to dependency files:

1. Run dependency install to sync
2. Clear caches if needed

### Research

Location: `rnd/`

**Naming:** `topic-name` (e.g., `boxing`, `indexes`)

Conduct all research and exploration in the `rnd/` folder. Create a new subfolder for each research topic.

### No Deferring Cheap Work

- NEVER defer work because it seems "not important right now"
- If something can be done in the current context (a hook, a test, a small fix) — do it
- The cost of doing small things now ≈ 0; the cost of forgetting them later > 0
- Don't optimize for "focus" by skipping cheap tasks — that's a human-team heuristic, not applicable to LLM agents

### Running Project Scripts

Prefer project scripts over running files directly.

Before running commands:

1. Check `package.json` for available scripts
2. Use `npm run <script>`

Scripts handle working directory, arguments, and pre/post steps. Direct file execution may skip important setup.
